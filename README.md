# Thank you / Dependencies

Thank you to the following people and developers. I couldn't have deployed my
website without your projects, open-source code, documentation, articles,...

- [This R-bloggers article](http://estebanmoro.org/post/2019-02-02-setting-up-your-blog-with-rstudio-and-blogdown-i-creating-the-blog/) by Esteban Moro.
  _I didn't even know creating a blog on R was possible._

- The [Hugo Setup Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hugo-setup) on the Github Action Marketplace.
  _Basically what automatically deploys my blog every time I push on `main`_.

  - Big special mention for this Tip/Tutorial/Walk-through of how to make your
    first deployment.
