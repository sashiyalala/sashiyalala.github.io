<h2>Some nonsense</h2>
<div style="text-align: right">
<em>for starters‚Ä¶</em>
</div>
<p>A big portion of my day-to-day consists in <strong>journaling</strong> in small parts.
Or, rather, noting down many of the things I do, I‚Äôve done, I have to do,‚Ä¶etc.</p>
<p>I find that it‚Äôs easier-for me, at least- to process everything that happens in a day if I write it down, for some reason.
I guess you could say that I force my brain to recall the events on that day, playing some sort of memory game.</p>

</div>
<p>Getting real for a moment: periods of my life during which I <em>have</em> made an effort to write down stuff in a journal, notebook, agenda, etc. are the ones that I remember better.
Not because I re-read them, which I really don‚Äôt.
In fact whenever I do a big notebook/papers/stationary cleanout, I tend to read my stuff and just surprise myself with all the things I did, how I felt, make myself think so much about how I‚Äôve changed.
The latter is actually one of the big reasons I don‚Äôt clean out my stuff that often‚Ä¶I dread the emotional effort I‚Äôm going to put myself through, ironically.</p>

</div>
<p>I don‚Äôt know whether it is the effect or the reason behind it, but <em>yes</em>: I am easily pulled by nostalgia.</p>

<p>About 3 or 4 years ago I decided to ‚Äòlive more in the present‚Äô and not to occupy myself with taking pictures, recording and writing down whatever that was happening just to reminisce on it later instead of experiencing it.
Add some unexpected good, bad and varying feeling-evoking events to life and now I feel like ever since the pandemic (or even before then, to be honest) I can‚Äôt really tell how much time has passed, how I‚Äôve changed or what direction I am going in. Of course I can, though, I am aware of myself, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I know myself enough that I feel like I could remember more, at times?</p>

<p>As someone who leans more controlling than most, this does slightly stress me out.
I don‚Äôt need a plan, <em>per se</em>. In fact, I <em>don‚Äôt want</em> it. But‚Ä¶ I guess I want to be able to stop sometimes and look around the path that I‚Äôm walking on, instead of mindlessly taking steps that disappear right after I get off from them, like, you know, the ones in platform games when you get through the first levels and the platforms disappear after you step on them for a certain amount of time to throw you some sort of <em>curve ball</em>.</p>

<p>Each one of us has different interests, even something as‚Ä¶weird?‚Ä¶as how much we like or hate to do some introspection, how we feel about it, checking in with ourselves about our feelings or even the outright intensity with which we feel our feelings or how we manifest them(lol wtf).</p>

<div id="sowhy" class="section level2">
<h2>so‚Ä¶why</h2>
<p><em>Anyways</em>, I could get deeper and deeper, but what I‚Äôm failing to say here is that I wanna use this as the place where I write down many of the things that I choose to note down.
Be it silly pictures or opinions on movies, tutorials or straight-up notes on Math and/or Computer Science,‚Ä¶
whatever the hell it is I just wanna record it somewhere that pleases the idea on my mind about having a ‚Äúmaster book‚Äù of sorts where I can access <del>mostly</del> everything I know.
And if you want to check on it every once in a while, I‚Äôm ok with that. And if you don‚Äôt want to come even close to this link ever again, I‚Äôm even more ok with that!</p>

<p>Personally, my experience growing up with the internet was getting into the type of communities that live on sharing information with everybody, open to feedback, etc.
The ‚Äúwe can all learn from everybody‚Äù-leaning type of mindset.</p>

<div id="what-are-you-trying-to-do-next" class="section level2">
<h2>what are you trying to do next¬ø</h2>
<p>Honestly, I <em>don‚Äôt really know</em>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm planning on doing a post talking about the categories of posts that I‚Äôm still planning, as well, the tags, the stuff I wanna focus on learning and documenting in the near future,‚Ä¶etc.
If for some reason you have any suggestions, don‚Äôt be afraid to hmu or comment something here? If I fix the disqus plugin that allows comments‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>I‚Äôm still extremely unsure on whether to link this blog to my fucking Linkedin page, of all places‚Ä¶I want to be able to show off my recording-stuff skills, though, I guess?</p>
<p>P.D.: are there any less dumb synonyms for ‚Äústuff‚Äù or am I just annoying myself by repeating the word over and over? Also, thank you for reading until here?? <code>What</code>.</p>

<p>As a closing message, please treat others the way you would like to get treated, don‚Äôt be an asshole to animals, respect people‚Äôs identities, tip your waiters and public service workers.</p>
<p>I wish you a very nice day, happy times with the people in your life and some healing time if you would like itüíï</p>
